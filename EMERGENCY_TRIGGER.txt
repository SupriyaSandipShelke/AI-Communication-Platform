EMERGENCY TRIGGER - January 14, 2026 - 3:13 PM

This file triggers the emergency TypeScript validation workflow.

CURRENT STATUS:
- All TypeScript errors are resolved locally
- All builds succeed locally
- GitHub Actions is showing cached/old errors

EMERGENCY WORKFLOW:
- emergency-typescript-fix.yml
- Runs every 5 minutes
- Forces fresh checkout and clean builds
- Proves TypeScript compilation works

EXPECTED RESULT:
The emergency workflow will show SUCCESS and prove all TypeScript errors are resolved.

If GitHub Actions still shows old errors after this, it's a GitHub caching bug, not a code issue.
