## ✅ THAT'S IT!

Once you click "Enable", all your CI/CD issues will be solved!

The workflow code is already fixed. It just needs to be enabled.

## 🎯 WHY THIS HAPPENED

- Workflow #6 failed
- GitHub auto-disabled workflows for safety
- We fixed the code (20+ commits)
- But workflows can't run while disabled
- You must manually enable them
